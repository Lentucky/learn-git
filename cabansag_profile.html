            My goals are to be happy, to somehow satisfy my desire of what a content life is. <br>
            Whether that be earning decent money that I can buy anything I want, or doing <br>
            the hobbies that I love so much. 
            <br><br>
            I aspire to become an even better person than I am, no matter what. Even if I'm <br>
            burned out, depressed, I have to keep pushing regardless. I aspire to have better <br>
            skills in drawing, in the profession I chose, mentally and of course physically. <br>
            So I have to put in the hours, the minutes and seconds necessary to get there. <br>
            <br>
            When the going get's tough, the tough gets going.
